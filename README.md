devbox
======

There are many devboxes available worldwide but this one has up to date
configuration of such I am using everyday for development. It does not
have any project specific, it just sets up common software for me.

I am primarily develop using Python so this devbox has a lot of Python
specific: pyenv, virtualenvs etc. Also it has preconfigured neovim and
my dotfiles.

Usage is quite simple: just vagrant up it and you are done. All devbox
provisioning is performed using Ansible (2.2 and newer). Main OS is
Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial.

That is basically all. I do not want to create huge readme file on the
usage because, well, it has only one user. But if you find some pieces
useful, feel free to grab.
